# Installation

- Install processing : www.processing.org/download
- Clone the repository

# How it works

- Put a .txt file in the data folder
- Launch the program JULIA.app

**Software**

First Julia reads all the .txt files in the data folder. Then, Julia converts a text from a .txt file from the data folder to a binary String. This function generates a .txt "textB.txt" and print the binary Strings in this file. After that, the last function call matrix() or matrix2() draws in Pgraphics a matrix of ellipse. They are colls of ellipses on the side and top of the card. Those will be allways  at the same place for every text. Between those colls there is ellipse corresping to your text in binary.
